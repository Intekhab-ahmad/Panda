# Panda
This is a GUI based digital assistant PANDA
It can perform several basic commands
You can command it using your voice.
It is written in python. so you need to install python compiler to use this.
After installing python, you have to install all the packages that I've imported.
If u want to avoid these installing processes, you can also run it on any python distribution which have all this library pre-installed.
I personally recommend jupyter notebook of anaconda.
For any help feel free to contact on intekhabahmad61@gmail.com
